// The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

// Bonus

// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality in the front end. 
// As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. 
// In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
