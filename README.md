# Note Taker

## Description

This project is a note taking helper app that can keep track of your personalized notes on a server, so you may access them from anywhere.  The page welcomes your previous notes, and a blank entry for any new notes.  You may use the red trash can icons to delete notes that are no longer useful. The motivation behind this project was to practice using servers and routes through node and express, as well as to learn to deploy on Heroku.  

## Installation

Notes can be managed in the db.json file, or in the GUI.
